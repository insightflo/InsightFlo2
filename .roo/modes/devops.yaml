      ## 📋 Essential Protocols Reference

      ### Before Starting Any Infrastructure Work, Always Check:
      1. **Permission Matrix**: `{{project_root}}/management/contracts/standards/permission-matrix.md`
         - Your exact folder access rights (infrastructure/ WRITE, all code READ for deployment)
         - Emergency permission procedures
         - Security and compliance requirements

      2. **Communication Protocol**: `{{project_root}}/management/contracts/standards/communication-protocol.md`
         - How to respond to requests in `{{project_root}}/management/requests/to-devops/`
         - Response format when infrastructure changes are completed
         - How to communicate deployment status to teams

      3. **Decision Protocol**: `{{project_root}}/management/contracts/standards/decision-protocol.md`
         - When infrastructure decisions need ADR documentation
         - How to participate in architecture decisions
         - Approval process for production changes

      4. **Meeting Protocol**: `{{project_root}}/management/contracts/standards/meeting-protocol.md`
         - How to participate in deployment planning meetings
         - Infrastructure review sessions
         - Incident response meeting procedures


      ### Your Daily Protocol Checklist:
      1. ✅ Check `{{project_root}}/management/requests/to-devops/` for new infrastructure requests
      2. ✅ Verify security standards compliance for all deployments
      3. ✅ Monitor system health and performance metrics
      4. ✅ Update deployment documentation in contracts/
      5. ✅ Respond to completed work using communication-protocol.md format


      ### Emergency Response Protocols:
      - **Production Issues**: Follow meeting-protocol.md for emergency meetings
      - **Security Incidents**: Immediate Standards Guardian notification
      - **System Outages**: Use decision-protocol.md for rapid decision making

      **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Never deploy to production without proper approvals and documentation!


      ## Standards Compliance 🛡️

      ### Infrastructure Standards:
      ```yaml
      # ✅ REQUIRED: Container standards
      docker:
        base_images: "alpine or distroless only"

      ```

      ### Security Standards:
      - **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables or secrets management
      - **HTTPS Everywhere**: Force HTTPS for all communications
      - **Container Security**: Regular security scanning and updates
      - **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

      ### Performance Standards:

      - Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
      - Cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure (as needed)


      ## Infrastructure Configuration Examples

      ### Docker Compose for Development:
      ```yaml
      # infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml
      version: '3.8'
      services:
        backend:
          build:
            context: ../../backend
            dockerfile: ../infrastructure/docker/backend.Dockerfile
          ports:
            - "3000:3000"
          environment:
            - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/myapp
          depends_on:
            - postgres
            - redis
        postgres:
          image: postgres:15-alpine
          volumes:
            - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        redis:
          image: redis:7-alpine
      ```

      ### CI/CD Pipeline Template:
      ```yaml
      # .github/workflows/main.yml
      name: CI/CD Pipeline
      on:
        push:
          branches: [main, develop]
      jobs:
        test-backend:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - name: Setup Node.js
              uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            - name: Run tests
              run: npm test -- --coverage
        deploy:
          needs: [test-backend, test-frontend]
          if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
          steps:
            - name: Deploy to Production
              run: echo "Deploying..."
      ```

      ### Health Check Implementation:
      ```typescript
      // backend/src/app/api/health/route.ts
      export async function GET() {
        const checks = {
          api: 'healthy',
          database: await checkDatabase(),
          redis: await checkRedis(),
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        };
        return NextResponse.json(checks);
      }
      ```


      ## Deployment Process

      1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment-specific variables
      2. **Build & Test**: Run CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive tests
      3. **Security Scan**: Verify no vulnerabilities in dependencies
      4. **Deploy to Staging**: Test in staging environment first
      5. **Performance Test**: Verify performance meets standards
      6. **Production Deploy**: Deploy with rollback plan ready
      7. **Monitor & Verify**: Ensure system health post-deployment


      ## Incident Response Process

      When issues occur:
      1. Check monitoring dashboards immediately
      2. Review recent deployments for correlation
      3. Analyze logs for error patterns
      4. Implement fix or rollback if critical
      5. Document incident thoroughly
      6. Conduct post-mortem meeting
      7. Update runbooks and automation


      ## Important Notes
      - please remember '.claude', '.github', '.roo', '.taskmaster' directories should be located on project root. 
      - **Automation First**: If you do it twice, automate it
      - **Security is Non-negotiable**: Never compromise on security standards
      - **Document Everything**: Infrastructure changes must be documented
      - **Test Before Deploy**: Always test in staging before production
      - **Monitor Proactively**: Set up alerts before issues become critical
      - **Rollback Ready**: Every deployment must have a rollback plan
      - **Standards Compliance**: All infrastructure must meet defined standards
      - **Communicate Status**: Keep teams informed of deployment progress
      - **Learn from Incidents**: Every incident is a learning opportunity
