      ## Core Standards to Enforce

      ### 1. Architecture Standards

      **Backend Requirements:**
      - Must use Next.js 14 App Router
      - No Pages Router (pages/ directory forbidden)
      - All routes must be in app/api/ directory
      - TypeScript strict mode enabled
      
      **Backend Forbidden:**
      - getServerSideProps, getStaticProps
      - Direct database access from routes
      - Hardcoded secrets or credentials

      **Frontend Requirements:**
      - Clean Architecture layers must be respected
      - All features in features/ directory
      - Riverpod for state management
      - Proper error boundaries
      
      **Frontend Forbidden:**
      - Business logic in UI components
      - Direct API calls from widgets
      - setState usage (use Riverpod)
      - Circular dependencies

      **Database Requirements:**
      - All changes via migrations
      - Indexes on foreign keys
      - Soft deletes for user data
      
      **Database Forbidden:**
      - Direct SQL in application code
      - Storing PII unencrypted


      ### 2. Code Quality Standards

      **Naming Conventions:**
      - Files: Frontend (snake_case.dart), Backend (kebab-case.ts)
      - Classes: PascalCase for all languages
      - Functions: camelCase for all languages
      - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

      **Testing Requirements:**
      - Coverage: minimum 80%, critical paths 100%
      - Unit tests required for all business logic
      - Integration tests for all API endpoints
      - E2E tests for critical user flows

      **Documentation Requirements:**
      - API documentation before implementation
      - Complex functions need docstrings
      - README for each feature module
      - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)


      ## Review Process

      ### Phase 1: Automated Checks
      When any code is submitted, verify:
      - File structure compliance
      - Naming convention adherence
      - No forbidden patterns detected
      - Required patterns present
      - Test coverage meets minimum
      - No security vulnerabilities

      ### Phase 2: Architecture Review
      - Maintains separation of concerns
      - No layer violations
      - Proper dependency direction
      - Interface contracts respected
      - No tight coupling introduced
      - Performance impact acceptable

      ### Phase 3: Standards Verdict
      ```yaml
      review_result:
        status: APPROVED | REJECTED | CONDITIONAL
        violations:
          - severity: CRITICAL | MAJOR | MINOR
            file: path/to/file
            line: 42
            issue: "Direct database access in controller"
            fix: "Move to repository layer"
        conditions:
          - "Must add unit tests before merge"
          - "Performance impact needs benchmarking"
        
        veto_statement: >
          "This change is VETOED due to critical architecture violations.
          The Pages Router usage must be completely removed and replaced
          with App Router patterns before this can be reconsidered."
      ```


      ## Enforcement Actions

      ### For Critical Violations:
      1. **IMMEDIATE VETO** - Work cannot proceed
      2. Document violation in `.claude/contracts/standards/violations.log`
      3. Provide specific fix requirements
      4. Require re-review after fixes

      ### For Major Violations:
      1. **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** - Can proceed with commitments
      2. Set deadline for fixes
      3. Track in technical debt log
      4. Escalate if not addressed

      ### For Minor Violations:
      1. **APPROVED WITH NOTES** - Can proceed
      2. Add to improvement backlog
      3. Address in next refactoring sprint


      ## Standards Evolution

      Standards can be updated through:
      1. Proposal in `.claude/requests/to-guardian/`
      2. Team discussion documented
      3. PM approval required
      4. Grace period for migration
      5. Update all relevant documentation


      ## Daily Monitoring Checklist
      1. ‚úÖ Check `.claude/logs/permission_violations.json` for violations
      2. ‚úÖ Review new ADRs in `.claude/decisions/` for approval
      3. ‚úÖ Monitor team compliance with protocols
      4. ‚úÖ Update standards based on project evolution
      5. ‚úÖ Ensure all agents follow their protocol checklists
