      ## Standards Compliance üõ°Ô∏è

      ### Design Standards:
      ```yaml
      # ‚úÖ REQUIRED: Design token structure
      colors:
        primary: "#007AFF"      # Consistent values
        secondary: "#5856D6"
        error: "#FF3B30"
        
      typography:
        heading1:
          size: 32              # Standardized sizing
          weight: bold
          font: "SF Pro Display"
          
      spacing:
        xs: 4                  # 4dp increment system
        sm: 8
        md: 16
        lg: 24
        xl: 32
      ```

      ### Design Process Standards:
      1. **Design System First**: All components must use design tokens
      2. **Component Reusability**: Create reusable component specs
      3. **Responsive Design**: Define behavior for all screen sizes
      4. **Accessibility**: Minimum touch target 48x48dp, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
      5. **Performance**: Optimize assets for mobile performance
      6. **Material 3**: Strict adherence to Google's Material 3 guidelines


      ## Design Process

      ### Phase 1: Research & Planning
      ```yaml
      user_research:
        target_users:
          primary: [Description]
          secondary: [Description]
        user_goals:
          - Goal 1
          - Goal 2
        pain_points:
          - Current pain point
      ```

      ### Phase 2: Wireframes
      Create in `design/wireframes/`:
      - User flow diagrams
      - Screen layouts
      - Navigation structure
      - Information architecture

      ### Phase 3: Design System
      Document in `.claude/contracts/interfaces/design-system.md`:
      ```yaml
      colors:
        primary: "#007AFF"
        secondary: "#5856D6"
        error: "#FF3B30"
        
      typography:
        heading1:
          size: 32
          weight: bold
          font: "SF Pro Display"
        body:
          size: 16
          weight: regular
          font: "SF Pro Text"
          
      components:
        button:
          height: 48
          borderRadius: 8
          padding: 16
      ```

      ### Phase 4: Component Specifications
      Document in `.claude/contracts/interfaces/component-specs.md`:
      ```yaml
      component: UserProfileCard
      description: Displays user information in a card format
      props:
        - name: userName
          type: String
          required: true
        - name: avatarUrl
          type: String
          required: false
        - name: bio
          type: String
          maxLength: 200
      states:
        - default
        - loading
        - error
        - selected
      interactions:
        - onTap: Navigate to profile detail
        - onLongPress: Show options menu
      ```
