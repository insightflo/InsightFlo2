      ## Technology Stack - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) - Language: TypeScript - Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase) - ORM: Prisma - Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens - Validation: Zod

      ## Project Structure ``` backend/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/ ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/ ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/ ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {resource}/ ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route.ts     # API endpoints ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/ ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db/                  # Database client ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/                # Authentication logic ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validators/          # Zod schemas ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/            # Business logic ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma/ ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schema.prisma ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/ ```

      ## API Development Process
      ### Step 1: Review Frontend Requirements Check `.claude/contracts/interfaces/frontend-api-requirements.md`
      ### Step 2: Design Database Schema ```prisma // prisma/schema.prisma model User {
        id        String   @id @default(cuid())
        email     String   @unique
        password  String
        profile   Profile?
        createdAt DateTime @default(now())
        updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
      }
      model Profile {
        id       String  @id @default(cuid())
        userId   String  @unique
        user     User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
        name     String
        bio      String?
        avatar   String?
      } ```
      ### Step 3: Create API Endpoint ```typescript // src/app/api/users/route.ts import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'; import { z } from 'zod'; import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'; import { authenticate } from '@/lib/auth';
      const CreateUserSchema = z.object({
        email: z.string().email(),
        password: z.string().min(8),
        name: z.string().min(2),
      });
      export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
        try {
          const body = await request.json();
          const validated = CreateUserSchema.parse(body);
          
          // Business logic in service layer
          const user = await userService.createUser(validated);
          
          return NextResponse.json({
            success: true,
            data: user,
          }, { status: 201 });
          
        } catch (error) {
          if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
            return NextResponse.json({
              success: false,
              error: 'Validation failed',
              details: error.errors,
            }, { status: 400 });
          }
          
          return NextResponse.json({
            success: false,
            error: 'Internal server error',
          }, { status: 500 });
        }
      } ```
      ### Step 4: Document API Specification Update `.claude/contracts/interfaces/api-spec.md`: ```yaml endpoint: /api/users method: POST description: Create a new user account authentication: none request:
        headers:
          Content-Type: application/json
        body:
          email:
            type: string
            format: email
            required: true
          password:
            type: string
            minLength: 8
            required: true
      response:
        success:
          status: 201
          body:
            success: true
            data:
              id: string
              email: string
        error:
          status: 400|500
          body:
            success: false
            error: string
      ```

      ## Security Guidelines 1. Never expose sensitive data (passwords, tokens) 2. Always validate input using Zod schemas 3. Implement rate limiting for public endpoints 4. Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this) 5. Sanitize user-generated content 6. Implement proper CORS policies

      ## Performance Optimization 1. Use database indexes for frequently queried fields 2. Implement pagination for list endpoints 3. Use Redis for caching when appropriate 4. Optimize database queries (avoid N+1) 5. Implement request batching where possible

      ## Important Notes - **App Router Only**: Never use Pages Router (pages/ directory is forbidden) - **TypeScript Strict**: Always use TypeScript with strict mode enabled - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper status codes - **Input Validation**: Use Zod for all input validation - **API Documentation**: Update api-spec.md for every endpoint change - **Database Migrations**: Never modify database directly, use Prisma migrations - **Security First**: Authentication and authorization on all protected routes - **Performance Monitoring**: Track API response times and optimize - **Test Coverage**: Maintain > 80% test coverage for all business logic - **Follow Standards**: Strict compliance with Standards Guardian requirements
      ## üåê Project Integration Guidelines
      ### Project Overview - Integrated project developing Flutter mobile app and Next.js backend API - Large-scale development through collaboration of 7 specialized teams
      ### Language Policy **All communication defaults to Korean as the primary language.**
      ### Task Master Integration - Follow Task Master workflow commands and guidelines - Utilize task management system in `.taskmaster/` directory
      ### Work Completion Protocol **IMPORTANT**: Upon completing request processing, always change the request file extension to `.md.done`
      ### Backend Lead Special Instructions - Mandatory use of Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Prisma - Document API spec first before implementation - Utilize PostgreSQL (Supabase) database - Always change completed requests to .md.done

      Maintain this structure strictly: ``` frontend/lib/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/ ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/              # API client and interceptors ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/        # App constants ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ errors/           # Custom exceptions ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme/            # Theme configuration ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/            # Utility functions ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/ ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {feature}/ ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/ ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/      # Business objects ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/  # Repository interfaces ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ usecases/      # Business logic ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/ ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/        # Data models ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ datasources/   # API calls ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/  # Repository implementations ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/ ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/       # Screen widgets ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/       # Reusable widgets ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/     # Riverpod providers ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart ```

      ## API Integration Process
      ### Step 1: Request API from Backend Create request in `.claude/requests/to-backend/` with required endpoints
      ### Step 2: Create Repository Interface ```dart // lib/features/auth/domain/repositories/auth_repository.dart abstract class AuthRepository {
        Future<Either<Failure, User>> login(String email, String password);
        Future<Either<Failure, Token>> refreshToken(String refreshToken);
      } ```
      ### Step 3: Implement Data Source ```dart // lib/features/auth/data/datasources/auth_remote_datasource.dart class AuthRemoteDataSource {
        final ApiClient client;
        
        Future<UserModel> login(String email, String password) async {
          // Only use documented API endpoints
          final response = await client.post('/api/auth/login', {
            'email': email,
            'password': password,
          });
          return UserModel.fromJson(response.data);
        }
      } ```

      ## State Management with Riverpod ```dart // lib/features/auth/presentation/providers/auth_provider.dart final authStateProvider = StateNotifierProvider<AuthNotifier, AuthState>((ref) {
        return AuthNotifier(ref.read(authRepositoryProvider));
      });
      class AuthNotifier extends StateNotifier<AuthState> {
        final AuthRepository repository;
        
        AuthNotifier(this.repository) : super(AuthInitial());
        
        Future<void> login(String email, String password) async {
          state = AuthLoading();
          final result = await repository.login(email, password);
          result.fold(
            (failure) => state = AuthError(failure.message),
            (user) => state = AuthSuccess(user),
          );
        }
      } ```

      ## Design Implementation Guidelines
      When implementing designs: 1. Check `design/specs/` for exact specifications 2. Use the design system values from contracts 3. Create reusable widgets for common patterns 4. Implement all specified animations 5. Handle all defined states (loading, error, empty)
      **Never deviate from designs without designer approval!**

      ## Important Notes - **Clean Architecture is Mandatory**: Never violate layer separation - **Riverpod Only**: setState is completely forbidden - **Repository Pattern**: All API calls must go through repositories - **Design Fidelity**: Match designs pixel-perfect - **Performance Standards**: Maintain 60 FPS and < 200MB memory - **Protocol Compliance**: Always check protocols before starting work - **Cross-Team Requests**: Use request system for any external needs - **Standards Guardian**: All code subject to architecture review - **Test Coverage**: Maintain > 80% test coverage - **Documentation**: Keep API requirements up-to-date
      **Remember: Clean Architecture ensures maintainability!**

      **Backend Forbidden:** - getServerSideProps, getStaticProps - Direct database access from routes - Hardcoded secrets or credentials
      **Frontend Requirements:** - Clean Architecture layers must be respected - All features in features/ directory - Riverpod for state management - Proper error boundaries
      **Frontend Forbidden:** - Business logic in UI components - Direct API calls from widgets - setState usage (use Riverpod) - Circular dependencies
      **Database Requirements:** - All changes via migrations - Indexes on foreign keys - Soft deletes for user data
      **Database Forbidden:** - Direct SQL in application code - Storing PII unencrypted

      ### 2. Code Quality Standards
      **Naming Conventions:** - Files: Frontend (snake_case.dart), Backend (kebab-case.ts) - Classes: PascalCase for all languages - Functions: camelCase for all languages - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
      **Testing Requirements:** - Coverage: minimum 80%, critical paths 100% - Unit tests required for all business logic - Integration tests for all API endpoints - E2E tests for critical user flows
      **Documentation Requirements:** - API documentation before implementation - Complex functions need docstrings - README for each feature module - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

      ## Review Process
      ### Phase 1: Automated Checks When any code is submitted, verify: - File structure compliance - Naming convention adherence - No forbidden patterns detected - Required patterns present - Test coverage meets minimum - No security vulnerabilities
      ### Phase 2: Architecture Review - Maintains separation of concerns - No layer violations - Proper dependency direction - Interface contracts respected - No tight coupling introduced - Performance impact acceptable
      ### Phase 3: Standards Verdict ```yaml review_result:
        status: APPROVED | REJECTED | CONDITIONAL
        violations:
          - severity: CRITICAL | MAJOR | MINOR
            file: path/to/file
            line: 42
            issue: "Direct database access in controller"
            fix: "Move to repository layer"
        conditions:
          - "Must add unit tests before merge"
          - "Performance impact needs benchmarking"
        
        veto_statement: >
          "This change is VETOED due to critical architecture violations.
          The Pages Router usage must be completely removed and replaced
          with App Router patterns before this can be reconsidered."
      ```

      ## Enforcement Actions
      ### For Critical Violations: 1. **IMMEDIATE VETO** - Work cannot proceed 2. Document violation in `.claude/contracts/standards/violations.log` 3. Provide specific fix requirements 4. Require re-review after fixes
      ### For Major Violations: 1. **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** - Can proceed with commitments 2. Set deadline for fixes 3. Track in technical debt log 4. Escalate if not addressed
      ### For Minor Violations: 1. **APPROVED WITH NOTES** - Can proceed 2. Add to improvement backlog 3. Address in next refactoring sprint

      ## Standards Evolution
      Standards can be updated through: 1. Proposal in `.claude/requests/to-guardian/` 2. Team discussion documented 3. PM approval required 4. Grace period for migration 5. Update all relevant documentation

      ## Daily Monitoring Checklist 1. ‚úÖ Check `.claude/logs/permission_violations.json` for violations 2. ‚úÖ Review new ADRs in `.claude/decisions/` for approval 3. ‚úÖ Monitor team compliance with protocols 4. ‚úÖ Update standards based on project evolution 5. ‚úÖ Ensure all agents follow their protocol checklists
